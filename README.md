# Containers on AWS Elastic Beanstalk

This project demonstrates how to containerize a web application using **Docker** and deploy it to **AWS Elastic Beanstalk**. The application is a simple Nginx server with a custom HTML page.

## 🛠️ What I Did

- Learned how **Docker** containers work and created a basic web app using **Nginx**.
- Wrote a `Dockerfile` to build a custom Docker image.
- Ran the image locally using `docker run` and fixed a port conflict.
- Deployed the custom Docker container to **AWS Elastic Beanstalk** using the web interface.

## 🐳 Dockerfile Example

```dockerfile
FROM nginx:latest
COPY index.html /usr/share/nginx/html/
EXPOSE 80

## Built the Image With:

```bash
docker build -t my-web-app .
```

## Ran the Container With:

```bash
docker run -p 80:80 my-web-app
```

## 🌱 Key Learnings

- Containers simplify deployment and ensure consistency.
- Docker Desktop helps debug container issues easily.
- Elastic Beanstalk provides a quick way to host Docker containers without managing infrastructure manually.
